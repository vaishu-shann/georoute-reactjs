## React-Leaflet

 React Application to plot location route using leaflet.js
 React, React DOM and Leaflet are required peer dependencies. You must add them to your project if they are not already installed:
  ### Node

[Node](http://nodejs.org/) is really easy to install & now include [NPM](https://npmjs.org/).
You should be able to run the following command after the installation procedure
below.

    $ node --version
    v12.14.1

    $ npm --version
    6.13.4

## Start & watch in Development (Local)

    $ npm install
    $ npm start

 
 ### Leaflet Installation

    $ npm install react-leaflet
    
   Finally, you can import the necessary components. For example:
   
    import { MapContainer, TileLayer, Marker, Popup } from 'react-leaflet'
    
  
### Documentaion

 ### MQTT
 MQTT.js is a client library for the [MQTT](http://mqtt.org/) protocol, written
in JavaScript for node.js and the browser.

## Installation

```sh
npm install mqtt --save
```

<a name="example"></a>
## Example

For the sake of simplicity, let's put the subscriber and the publisher in the same file:

```js
const mqtt = require('mqtt')
const client  = mqtt.connect('mqtt://test.mosquitto.org')

client.on('connect', function () {
  client.subscribe('presence', function (err) {
    if (!err) {
      client.publish('presence', 'Hello mqtt')
    }
  })
})

client.on('message', function (topic, message) {
  // message is Buffer
  console.log(message.toString())
  client.end()
})
```

output:
```
Hello mqtt
```

If you want to run your own MQTT broker, you can use
[Mosquitto](http://mosquitto.org) or
[Aedes-cli](https://github.com/moscajs/aedes-cli), and launch it.

You can also use a test instance: test.mosquitto.org.
